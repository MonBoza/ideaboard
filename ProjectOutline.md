# Social Networking App for Neurodivergent Individuals

## This program is built for

* Neurodivergent individuals
* Parents of neurodivergent individuals
* Partners and friends of neurodivergent individuals

### The purpose of the program

* Is to create a user-friendly and inclusive social networking app.
* Establish a supportive community for neurodivergent individuals and their loved ones. 
* Create connections, learning and sharing of experiences among the community members.

### My end goal

* To provide a safe, supportive and informative space for neurodivergent individuals and their loved ones to connect, learn and share experiences. 
* Create a resource hub with articles and user-generated content to aid in learning and skill development.
* Foster a community of mutual support and information exchange among neurodivergent individuals and their allies.

### Roadblocks

* I think one major roadblock I will have would be the fact that I still need to learn a bit more about the different frameworks. Maybe then decide which would be best for this application.

### If I were to begin this program today

* Plan and Research thoroughly on the needs and preferences of neurodivergent individuals and come up with a plan for the the apps features. 


### Features

* User Profiles - Ideally I would like it to have User Profiles and allow users to share as much or little information as desired.
* Forums - categorized discussion boards (by topic) for users to ask questions, and share experiences or provide advice.
* Resources - a list of resources, articles and other resources provided by users to help people learn and develope skills.
* Event Calender - Highlighting workshops events online or in person.

### Possible Technologies

* Front-end: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
* Back-end: Node.js
* Database: MongoDB (I think)
