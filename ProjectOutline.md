# Social Networking App for Neurodivergent Individuals

## Objective:
My goal is to create a user-friendly, inclusive social networking app. I want it to provide a supportive community for neurodivergent individuals, their parents, partners and friends.

### Features
1. User Profiles - Ideally I would like it to have User Profiles and allow users to share as much or little information as desired.
2. Forums - categorized discussion boards (by topic) for users to ask questions, and share experiences or provide advice.
3. Resources - a list of resources, articles and other resources provided by users to help people learn and develope skills.
5. Event Calender - Highlighting workshops events online or in person.

### Technology stack
- Front-end: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Back-end: Node.js
- Database: MongoDB (I think)

#### My goal
The goal of this project is to provide a safe, supportive and informative space for neurodivergent individuals and their loved ones to connect, learn and share experiences. Hopefully creating a community of people helping people.
